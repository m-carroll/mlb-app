# mlb-app

Heyheyhey, this is my final project. Go to www.whosonfirst.ca to view it. You can click on the navbar across the top to see live updates on today's games. If there's no games being played today, then check out an old game! You can pick a date to see the complete game overview for any game played on that date.

It may not look all that interactive, but that' just sloppy UI. Click on inning event cards in the left sidebar to expand atbats to see pitches, and expand pitch boxes to see details on those. You can toggle different innings as well. Enjoy!
